Interactive plot recreated in Shiny.

### Functions

Two functions are defined as follows. One for calculating the rate of transcription and translation. And second used for plotting.

### Data

The dataset contains the read counts and FPKM values for the conducted experiments. The gene expression was quantified using Salmon[[1](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/)], imported to R using tximport[[2](https://github.com/mikelove/tximport)] and normalized with DESeq2[[3](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html)]. FPKM values were produced using DESeq2.

## Polysome association dynamics

Measurements of transcription (∆TS) and translation (∆TL) rates were obtained as a fraction of total and polysome-bound expression values at particular stages compared with the egg stage as baseline. Translational regulation is defined as a non-linear relationship  between  transcription and translation rates.

<center>
$transcription\ rate (∆TS)=\frac{total(stage\ x)}{total(egg)}$; $translation\ rate(∆TL)=\frac{polysome(stage\ x)}{polysome(egg)}$

### Examples

Run in the interactive session only
```{r examles, eval=FALSE}
if (interactive()) {
    runPlot()
}
```
